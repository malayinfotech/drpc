// Package drpcpool is a simple connection pool for clients.
//
// It has the ability to maintain a cache of connections with a
// maximum size on both the total and per key basis. It also
// can expire cached connections if they have been inactive in
// the pool for long enough.
//
// Implementation note: the cache has some methods that could
// potentially be quadratic in the worst case in the number of
// per cache key connections. Specifically, this worst case happens
// when there are many closed entries in the list of values. While
// we could do a single pass filtering closed entries, the logic is
// a bit harder to follow and ensure is correct. Instead we have a
// helper to remove a single entry from a list without knowing where
// it came from. Since we can possibly call that to remove every
// element from a list if they are all closed, it's quadratic in
// the maximum size of that list. Since this cache is intended to
// be used with small key capacities (like 5), the decision was made
// to accept that quadratic worst case for the benefit of having as
// simple an implementation as possible.
